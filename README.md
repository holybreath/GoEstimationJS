# GoEstimationJS
A javascript library for Estimation in Go game

Go is a classic board game with a long history, particularly hot recently due to the exciting game between AlphaGo and Lee sedol. 

This library provides a estimation function of Go. The original intention of the project is to contribute to the great online go server: online-go.com, but now it is free to use or modified for any purpose, ONLY IF: delcare it somewhere and notify me.

Play around with it by the link below:

For example, load => next => next5. Then you can see how the territories change.
